CODE - HW03 - CompSci 289A

The code for this assignment includes several Jupyter notebooks (CS289A_HW03_prob#.ipynb) that include code for each dataset, as well as a supplemental python modules (HW03_utils.py). The Jupyter notebooks contain the code used to carry out the problems and are commented to be self-explanatory. The utilities file is only used for overhead processes, namely loading the data from the .mat files.
