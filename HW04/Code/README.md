CODE - HW04 - CompSci 289A

The code for this assignment includes 2+ Jupyter notebooks (CS289A_HW04_Prob1.ipynb, CS289A_HW04_Prob4.ipynb) that include code for Problems 1 and 4. Additionally, there is a supplemental python module (HW04_utils.py). The description of each file is as follows:

CS289A_HW04_prob1.ipynb		-documentation of numeric calculations for problem 1
CS289A_HW04_prob4.ipynb		-main code for partitioning, training, & (most importantly ;) ) testing wine
HW04_utils.py			-utility module with functions to load & format data files 

*the .py module must be in the PYTHONPATH for the problem 4 notebook to work properly.

Both Jupyter notebooks contain internal documentation describing their procedures.
